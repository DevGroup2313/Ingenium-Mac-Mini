# Ingenium 4.0: how the page is made

`ingenium.html` in the four Ingenium repositories is built, not written by hand. These are its sources.

- `build/base312.html.gz`: Ingenium 3.12 as it was released, the base of every 4.0 build.
- `build/build_page.py`: applies the exact-match edits listed in it (each must match the base once) and inserts
  the parts in `build/modules/` (r101 onwards, in name order) before the page's last script.
  `python3 build/build_page.py out.html` writes the page.
- `build/release.py`: `python3 build/release.py page` builds the page, stamps the version from
  `build/version.json`, rebuilds the kit store from the repositories' current commits and writes the same page into
  all four repositories (it expects them side by side under /home/user). `release.py bump <version> <date>` moves
  the build number in every build file.
- `icon/`: the seal's tab icons and the 512-pixel picture the page draws (`icon/new/out/page_icons.json`), and the
  script that made the app icons for every device.
- `rig/`: the tests. `run_app.py` serves the page with the desktop app's own back-end, headless; `up.sh` starts it;
  the `t_*.js` scripts drive the page in Chromium through Playwright (layout checks, chat, cloud connections against
  `mockcloud.py`, seal, Code page, coding models, smoke test of every page).

Changing this folder starts no build. The builds start when `ingenium.html` (or a build file) changes.

Stages 2l to 2n (17 October 2026) added three page tests that run against the built page served by any static
server (`python3 -m http.server 8150` in the folder that holds it), with Playwright's Chromium:

`build/apps/builtin/` holds the copies of The Forge, Inkwell and Carpe Diem that Ingenium carries (each page
compressed, with `builtin.json` naming its version, date, size and SHA-256 fingerprint). To update them, run
`python3 -I build/apps/update_builtin.py path/to/the_forge.html path/to/Inkwell.html [path/to/carpe_diem.html]`; without
the third path the Carpe Diem copy already there stays. The build checks each against its fingerprint before it rides
along. Ingenium does not carry itself (a page cannot hold its own copy): from 4.9 each new version keeps its own page in
the app library on first start, checked against the version it names, so Lector and Fabrica can work on it.

`build/thoughts/` holds the two shared sources that Ingenium, Carpe Diem and The Forge each carry whole inside their
own page, so no app depends on another: `thought_cloud.html` (the 💭 thought panel and the Inbox) and
`support_core.html` (the support module: calm, smaller steps, time, low-energy days, routines, the Focus room, Just
start). `build_page.py` writes the first in before `modules/r119.js` and the second before `modules/r121.js`.

`build/apps/` holds Carpe Diem's five apps, whole (her own single-page apps, the files Carpe Diem carries): Tabula,
Abacus, Imago (`slides.html`), Scriba and Fontes. Beside them are `dark.json` (Carpe Diem's night dress for each) and
`cd_prep.js` (Carpe Diem's own preparation of an app before it shows it). All of these come out of carpe_diem.html with
`python3 -I apps/extract_from_carpe_diem.py path/to/carpe_diem.html`. `cd_inject.json` holds what Carpe Diem adds to an
app's frame once it is open (the cut stones on the app keys, its seal, its pen); it is taken from the running page with
`node apps/harvest_cd_dress.js http://127.0.0.1:8150/carpe_diem.html`. `build_page.py` rides all of it into the page.
`modules/r118.js` prepares each app and `modules/r123.js` opens it as Carpe Diem does: full width with the Desk bar at
the top, the float key on the side column, floating windows with a tab each on the Desk bar, and a window of its own.
A window of its own carries every side button. The windows share the notes, the reminders, the thought Inbox, day and
night and the Clepsydra's settings, and only the main window writes the saved desk. In the Mac and Windows apps
`ingenium_app.py` opens that window and holds the shared parts (`open_lite`, `lite_hub_put`, `lite_hub_get`).
